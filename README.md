## 📖 What is breast-cancer-wdbc-ml?

This application helps you understand and predict if a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). It uses a trusted dataset called the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset.

The tool applies a machine learning model called Logistic Regression that has 96.5% accuracy in telling if a tumor is malignant or benign. You benefit from:

- Clear data analysis to understand the health data
- Selecting the most important features for diagnosis
- Automatic training of the diagnosis model
- Interpretation of results for better understanding

You don't need to know any programming. The app guides you through each step with simple controls.

## 🔎 Features Explained

Here is what the app includes:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Quick overview of the dataset showing key statistics and charts. Helps you see trends in tumor sizes, shapes, and other details.

- **Feature Selection**  
  The app picks the most useful data points for making accurate predictions. This reduces errors and speeds up the process.

- **Model Training**  
  Your data goes through a Logistic Regression model that learns from past cases, improving prediction accuracy.

- **Interpretability Analysis**  
  The app explains why it gave a certain diagnosis based on the data features. This builds trust and understanding.

## 🛠 How It Works (Simple Terms)

The app uses data values from medical tests of tumors. It feeds these values into a system that has learned from many previous cases.

This system, called Logistic Regression, calculates the chance of the tumor being malignant or benign.

The app then shows the result clearly and gives extra details if you want.
